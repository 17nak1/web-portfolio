          I'm a Software Developer with a strong foundation in Mathematics, based in Kingston, ON, Canada. Over the years, I've had the privilege of working on a wide variety of projects, from developing scalable web applications to designing innovative software solutions that drive technical excellence.

          My career is driven by a passion for problem-solving and continuous learning. I specialize in building modern, maintainable systems using technologies like Ruby on Rails, React.js, and Node.js. I'm passionate about creating intuitive user experiences, optimizing backend processes, and ensuring high-quality code through test-driven development.

        <p>
          Along the way, I've gained experience in building RESTful APIs, managing databases, designing cloud-based deployments, and implementing event-driven architectures. I thrive in collaborative, agile environments where I can both learn from others and share my knowledge to help teams succeed.

          Outside of work, Iâ€™m often exploring new math concepts, staying up to date with the latest tech trends, or brainstorming creative ways to tackle complex challenges.
