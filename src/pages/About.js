      <p>I’m a Software Developer with a strong background in Mathematics, based in Kingston, ON, Canada. Over the past few years, I’ve had the opportunity to work on a diverse range of projects, developing scalable web applications, designing innovative software solutions, and helping teams drive technical excellence.

My career has been shaped by my love for problem-solving and continuous learning. I specialize in building modern, maintainable systems using a mix of technologies like Ruby on Rails, React.js, and Node.js, and I’m passionate about creating intuitive user experiences, optimizing back-end processes, and ensuring high-quality code through test-driven development.

Throughout my journey, I’ve worked on everything from building RESTful APIs and database management to designing cloud-based deployments and event-driven architectures. I believe in the power of collaboration and thrive in agile environments, where I can both learn from others and share my knowledge to help teams grow.

When I’m not coding, you’ll likely find me diving into new math concepts, exploring the latest tech trends, or brainstorming creative ways to solve complex challenges.

Feel free to check out my projects and get in touch if you’d like to collaborate or just chat about tech!</p>
